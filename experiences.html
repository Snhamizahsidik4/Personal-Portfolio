	<p>As a student, I need to manage my time between work and study so that it's not give bad effect to future. I work to get new experiences and to gain knowledge about the work. For your information, I have been given the opportunity to work as a promoter and my employer has given me a lot of guidance so that I can understand my duties. As promoter, I need to give the result of sales to employer for every month so we know how much the profit and the needed of customers. Beside that, I should give the task of demand, calculate the things that have sold out and many more. By the way, I also attend the events especially at mall to promote our brand and this help me to be more confident in public.</p>
